/// Note for implementors:
///
/// The [`Transport::poll`] method is potentially challenging to implement, notably it _must_
/// be cancellation safe, meaning that it cannot keep an internal state.
///
/// Most futures that needs to cross more than _one_ await-point are not cancel safe. The easiest
/// way to ensure cancel safety is to check the following conditions:
///
///  - Is only a single future awaited in a call to `poll`? Different calls can await different futures,
///    but each call can only await one.
///  - Is that future cancel safe? This is sometimes documented in libraries.
///
/// If making the future cancel safe is impossible, you can create a structure that contains a
/// `Box<dyn Future>`, and await that. The outer future will be cancellation safe, since
/// any internal state is stored within the boxed future.
///
/// Streams are also cancellation safe, a pattern frequently used in this library.
